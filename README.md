# sumo-matlab
MATLAB code for interacting with Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO)

# Example
Before running the script ``run_with_sumo.m``, you should already have SUMO running. The default assumes that you run SUMO on local machine, with the port 8813. For instance, run SUMO with ``sumo-gui --remote-port=8813``
